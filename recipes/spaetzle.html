<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p></p>
  <ul>
  <li>250g Spaetzle</li>
  <li>125g grated Emmenthaler cheese</li>
  <li>2 white, small onions</li>
  <li>50g butter</li>
  <li>Chives</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
<p></p>
  <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 200°C</li>
  <li>Grate the cheese</li>
  <li>Prepare the spaetzle according to packet instructions or make the homemade spaetzle recipe.</li>
  <li>Peel and chop the onions into thin strips. Fry the onions in half the butter, on medium to low heat until they are browned and caramelised.</li>
  <li>Melt the other half of the butter in a frying pan. Leave in the pan or pour into an ovenproof dish. Cover the bottom of the pan/dish with spaetzle. Then add a layer of cheese. Repeat this process until all the spaetzle and cheese are used up.</li>
  <li>Optional: Some like to add their kaesespaetzle into the oven at 200°C or 400°F for 5-10 minutes to crisp up. This is not necessary if your spaetzle are still hot and will melt the cheese.</li>
  <li>Top with caramelized onions and (optionally) sprinkle with the chives. </li>
  </ol>
